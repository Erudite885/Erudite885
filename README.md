👋   Hi there,

 -   My name is Bianca Uche and I am glad you found your way to my repo
 
 -   Here you will find my musings on the art of creating, developing, and evolving the spiders web until there is no way home. 

 -   Okay, not the spiders web, but my canvas of several projects focused on Frontend languages, libraries and frameworks 
     that provide solutions with a priority on user experience.
 
💞️ I have a passion for creating dynamic software solutions, 
   because learning never ends and solving challenges is fun.

📫 Its a pleasure having you, 
    if you would like to say Hi,
      You can always reach me via mail at erudite885@gmail.com, 
        I would love to correspond.
